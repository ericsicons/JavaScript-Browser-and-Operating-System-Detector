JavaScript-Browser-and-Operating-System-Detector
================================================

This advanced yet lightweight JavaScript detects the browser's name and version, the operating system's name and version, whether it is a 32 or 64 bit OS and also if the client is using a mobile device. You can use this script - for example - to display the browser and operating system information to your viewers, redirect pages and load customized content.
